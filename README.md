## Instructions

Each member of your team should modify this document in some way and
push their modifications to the repository in a separate commit. This
will ensure that you have set your repository up in a way that ensures
all group members are working with the same repository.

Note that you must compile your readme (this document) for it to
properly display as part of your github repository.

Once you have received feedback on your project proposal (via Canvas)
you may alter this README so that it describes your final project
instead of the project proposal.


## Data Set

The 'data set' is more of a database, as there are four separate Google Sheets with possible data sources. Most of the data is stored in the "Songs" Google Sheet, though one of the requested items for the Music Database is to make a display of the songs that were featured in the `Bourgeoisie' playlist, and that information is stored in the "Miscellaneous" Google Sheet. The links are below.

- [Songs](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1T3LxNnSTmUyefwX-i0nEmkPcg-mKYnb9RmcJ_DopIM8/edit?usp=sharing)
- [Artists](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1phfgD-aPoxDC_T3Te8hg2_rbpPJCk-yNCua98BYwpH0/edit?usp=sharing)
- [Albums](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QffuHFZZ6SdaLq7HEi8XTzKmUifinZgU9hZb8WYIDIU/edit?usp=sharing)
- [Miscellaneous](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_i_tN719jseXvPqpufLW8pTfEgDY5CpTRw9B14Sxewc/edit?usp=sharing)


## Short Project Description



## Potential Topics to Explore Using the Data Set

-Make a searchable database of listening statistics from August 2013 - present

-Incorporate an owner-friendly element where the owner can just submit a single month's worth of data and have the database update

-Add some nice graphics (artist trends, yearly/monthly trends, etc)

-Assuming I can get the owner to identify his 'must haves' vs just the desirables, we should be able to provide a client-requested interface that can be hosted in a shiny app and used as a replacement for the current Google Sheets method.
