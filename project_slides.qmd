## Outline

This presentation outlines the data and methods used to create a music database based on one person's listening history. We discuss the data sets that are used, the methods and packages utilized, and the analyses conducted. The database is housed at <https://mollyc.shinyapps.io/project-math-day-2020/>.

## Introduction

## Data Description

Data:

- consists of a collection of multiple Google sheets tracking one person's listening history
- consists of data about songs, artists, albums, and a particular playlist

## Data Description

Songs:

- more than 2100 songs, with multiple observations for each song
- an observation consists of the previous month's listening statistics for a particular song
- observations are recorded approximately once a month

## Data Description

Artists/Albums:

- more than 580 artists and 1100 albums
- linked closely to song sheet
- all artists/albums with songs in the song sheet have similar statistics recorded

## Data Description

- tracks which songs are added to a particular playlist (the playlist "Bourgeoisie")
- also contains information about number of songs per months and consecutive months for each song on the playlist
