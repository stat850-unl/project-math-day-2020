## Outline

This presentation outlines the data and methods used to create a music database based on one person's listening history. We discuss the data sets that are used, the methods and packages utilized, and the analyses conducted. The application can be found [here]( https://mollyc.shinyapps.io/project-math-day-2020/).

## What is SAAM

*   SAAM (Songs Artists Albums & Miscellaneous) is a data visualization R Shiny app. 
*   The main purpose of the app is to allow a user to easily search through years of collected listening data of one user and take their own deeper delves into the data.
*   The interactivity of the app is paramount; we wanted the user to feel as though any curiosity they had about a song, artist, or album could be answered by themselves through the app, giving the user a greater sense of self accomplishment.

## Data Description

Data:

- consists of a collection of multiple Google sheets tracking one person's listening history
- consists of data about songs, artists, albums, and a particular playlist

## Data Description

Songs:

- more than 2100 songs, with multiple observations for each song
- an observation consists of the previous month's listening statistics for a particular song
- observations are recorded approximately once a month

## Data Description

Artists/Albums:

- more than 580 artists and 1100 albums
- linked closely to song sheet
- all artists/albums with songs in the song sheet have similar statistics recorded

## Data Description

Miscellaneous:

- tracks which songs are added to a particular playlist (the playlist "Bourgeoisie")
- also contains information about number of songs per months and consecutive months for each song on the playlist


## Methods and Analysis

*   There was a lot of data, which was confusing and difficult to maneuver and nearly impossible to get any real information out of.
