## Outline

This presentation outlines the data and methods used to create a music database based on one person's listening history. We discuss the data sets that are used, the methods and packages utilized, and the analyses conducted. The application can be found [here]( https://mollyc.shinyapps.io/project-math-day-2020/).

## What is SAAM

*   SAAM (Songs Artists Albums & Miscellaneous) is a data visualization R Shiny app. 
*   The main purpose of the app is to allow a user to easily search through years of collected listening data of one user and take their own deeper delves into the data.
*   The interactivity of the app is paramount; we wanted the user to feel as though any curiosity they had about a song, artist, or album could be answered by themselves through the app, giving the user a greater sense of self accomplishment.

## Data Description

Data:

- consists of a collection of multiple Google sheets tracking one person's listening history
- consists of data about songs, artists, albums, and a particular playlist

## Data Description

Songs:

- more than 2100 songs, with multiple observations for each song
- an observation consists of the previous month's listening statistics for a particular song
- observations are recorded approximately once a month

## Data Description

Artists/Albums:

- more than 580 artists and 1100 albums
- linked closely to song sheet
- all artists/albums with songs in the song sheet have similar statistics recorded

## Data Description

Miscellaneous:

- tracks which songs are added to a particular playlist (the playlist "Bourgeoisie")
- also contains information about number of songs per months and consecutive months for each song on the playlist


## Methods and Analysis

*   There was **a lot** of data, which was confusing and difficult to maneuver and nearly impossible to get any real information out of.
*  Following it's name, SAAM is broken into four major tabs:
    *   Songs
    *   Artists
    *   Albumns
    *   Miscellanious

## Methods and Analysis : Songs

* The "Songs" tab has three sub-tabs:
    -   By Month
        - returns a sortable table of songs based on chosen month and hours and plays ranges.
    -   Individual Song Data
        - given a selected song, returns order statistics for given song, as well plots of statistics over time.
    -   Overall Song Data
        - returns a sortable table of songs based on hours, plays, and date ranges.

## Methods and Analysis : Artists

* The "Artists" tab has two sub-tabs:
    - Overall Artist Data
        - returns a sortable table of artists based on hours, plays, and date ranges.
    - Individual Artist Data
        - given a selected artist, returns order statistics for given artist, as well plots of statistics over time.

## Methods and Analysis : Albums

* The "Albums" tab consists of one general tab
    - This tab, given a selected artist, returns order statistics for given artist, as well plots of statistics over time.


## Methods and Analysis : Miscellaneous

* The "Miscellaneous" tab consists of two sub-tabs:
    - Bourgeoisie by Month
        - given a month and year, returns a table of all songs on the Bourgeoisie playlist at that time
    - Overall Bourgeoisie Info
        - returns a sortable table containing summary statistics for every song that has ever been put in the Bourgeoisie playlist.
